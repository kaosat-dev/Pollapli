This application is NOT usable yet, still in early stage of development .

Experimental remote monitoring and control system for Arduinos/Hydroponics/Repraps/Repstraps/3d scanners.

UPDATE: 01/06/2012
WAY too many updates to list here, project is still not in a really usable state, but sub elements here and there work, lots still remaining to be
done. If you are curious about the workings and the project, best look around the code/ the various commits

UPDATE: 04/17/2011
-The project now comes with buidout scripts for easier deployment : no need to have the dependencies installed: here is how you can setup and run 
Pollapli using buildout:
-check out the code from github
in command line :
- navigate to the directory you just checked out the code into 
- type python bootstrap.py (Optionally you can do pythonVERSIONNUM bootstrap.py : ie i use python2.6 bootstrap.py) 
- type buildout/buildout : here you will see buildout getting all the project dependencies and setting up an isolated python environment
DONE!
To run the project , just type , at the same place: buildout/Pollapli

In general:

Depencies:
* Works with Python 2.6/2.7 (not Python 3.0 compatible)
* You will need Twisted 11.0.0
* You will need to have pySerial installed
* for webcam support , pygst is required too
* to generate docs, sphinx and all its dependencies are required
