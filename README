//////////////////////////////

UPDATE: 07/16/2011
 MAJOR UPDATE :
WARNING : this version is UNUSABLE in its current state, as it include NO user interface
* the communication method to the server was changed to a complete REST  api
* it also uses longpolling : ie no more bruteforce polling
* a lot if not most of the server's system where heavilly modified or rewritten for a great deal more of clarity,
features and expandability
* this version adds support for addons for modularity
* this version also adds an sqlite database backend 
* the project is now using the python twisted library
* this version also support any amount of connected hardware (no guarantees on performance though)
* plug & play support of arduino based devices

OLD NEWS:
* The project now comes with buidout scripts for easier deployment : no need to have the dependencies installed: here is how you can setup and run 
Doboz-Web using buildout:
* check out the code from github
in command line :
*  navigate to the directory you just checked out the code into 
* type python bootstrap.py (Optionally you can do pythonVERSIONNUM bootstrap.py : ie i use python2.6 bootstrap.py)
* type bin/buildout : here you will see buildout getting all the project dependencies and setting up an isolated python environment
DONE!
To run the project , just type , at the same place: bin/dobozweb
For developpers , there are a few helper scripts as well:

Configuration:
* To change the serial speed and the adapted driver for your firmware, change the speed and driver lines in the config.cfg file in the "Reprap" section:
the only tested driver so far is Teacup, fived might work (feedbakc appreciated, as it does not respond with my reprap's motherboard)
* To change the webserver (wsgiref or tornado)  , just change the ServerType in the config.cfg file in the "WebServer" section
* To enable/disable webcam use : Change "use:False" (False or True must start with uppercase , as per python syntax)  in the config.cfg file in the "Webcam" section

Depencies:
* For now only tested with python 2.6
* You will need to have pySerial installed (normally deployed using the buildout method above)
* You will also need the twisted framework : for now you will need to install this seperatly, future versions
will have it included
* for webcam support , pygst is required too
* to generate docs, sphinx and all its dependencies are required
* the dependency on pyparsing was removed
